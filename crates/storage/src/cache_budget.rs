//! Process cache-budget division shared by every storage backend.

//! `dbcache` is one process-wide budget, not a per-database knob. The node
//! divides it across the persistent namespaces that exist in a deployment —
//! chainstate and transaction index — and every backend receives
//! its namespace's share in bytes through `open_with_cache`, which configures
//! exactly those bytes. Division floors each share and hands the rounding
//! remainder to chainstate, so the shares always sum to at most the budget.
//!
//! The percentages are fixed at 80/20 and are not configuration. A namespace
//! that is disabled in a deployment
//! contributes nothing: its share is redistributed to chainstate, which keeps
//! the sum within budget while giving the only live namespace the full headroom.
