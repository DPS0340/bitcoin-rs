# Capture a runtime stall

Run the watchdog outside the node. It watches a dedicated INFO-level log for
`sync progress`, with a monotonic deadline. After one missed deadline it
collects evidence, detaches the debugger, and exits. It does not use RPC,
metrics, the node logger, or any node mutex. Log rotation and truncation are
supported. The default 180 seconds allows three 60-second intervals.

## Requirements and cost

Use Linux, Python 3.11 or newer, GDB, and the matching executable and debug
symbols. GDB must have permission to attach; before watching, the watchdog
verifies it with one dry attach that momentarily pauses the target. Configure
that permission through the deployment's normal debugging policy; this tool
never changes ptrace settings, privileges, or node configuration. Keep the log
exclusive to this node and enable INFO telemetry. An unrelated log or disabled
INFO output cannot prove this node's liveness.

**GDB pauses the target during capture.** Invocation authorizes one diagnostic
attach, not passive monitoring. The watchdog limits GDB to 30 seconds plus five
seconds for termination, 32 frames per thread, and 16 MiB of output. Kernel
snapshots cover at most 256 threads and 4 KiB per field; the retained log tail
is at most 1 MiB. These are work/output bounds, not hard real-time guarantees
for filesystem I/O.

Prepare an existing private evidence directory, then run:

```sh
python3 scripts/watch_runtime_stall.py \
  --pid 12345 \
  --log /path/to/this-node.log \
  --output /path/to/private/evidence \
  --timeout 180
```

Replace the PID and paths with the running node's values. Each capture creates
a fresh mode-0700 subdirectory and never overwrites old evidence. Debugger
output can reveal addresses and application state; retain it privately.

## Reading the result

`result.json` records the PID/start identity, reason, debugger command, native
outcome and completeness. `threads.txt` has userspace backtraces with thread
names and IDs. `kernel-waits.txt` records kernel wait information.
`telemetry-tail.log` retains recent output. The watch ends when the original
process exits rather than following a restart. Identity is rechecked
immediately before attachment.

A timeout, denied attach, missing symbols or partial dump is not successful
diagnosis. Incomplete capture preserves available output and exits with failure.
After a debugger timeout, confirm the node's process state before intervening;
the tool never sends the node an unconditional continue or termination signal.

A missed cadence is **not a deadlock verdict**. Inspect all thread stacks for
blocked call sites and potential holders, then reconcile lock order with
source. Kernel `wchan` and `stack` fields are not userspace mutex-owner records.
Even a complete dump cannot automatically assign every `parking_lot` mutex an
owner. The historical stage-2 holder in #1094 remains unconfirmed until an
actual stalled-node capture is analyzed.

The event loop emits summaries by elapsed time after either periodic or
inbound wake work. Wake volume can no longer consume the tick-count multiples
that previously controlled reporting. A genuinely blocked loop still misses
the deadline and is visible to the independent watchdog.
